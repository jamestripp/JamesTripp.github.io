QSTEP asked me to support their students in their statistical methods modules. The aim was to provide hands on R work with various statistical methods, as used in my Psychology PhD, including:

* Bivariate regression
* Linear Regression
* Multiple Regression
* Multinomial Logit
* Proportional Odds

A focus throughout the sessions were to consider why one model is chosen, what research question it addresses, and how to evaluate the models ability to capture (or failure to capture) the pattern in the data.
