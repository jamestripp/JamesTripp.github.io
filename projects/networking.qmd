I worked with Godwin to develop an introductory network analysis skills workshop. 
It was a great chance to work with rmarkdown's render to github markdown option 
along with the rather superb references support via Zotero.

The workshop was delivered to faculty members from the History department at 
the University of Warwick. We used an existing dataset of quakers and carried 
out our analysis using Grapho - a tool I often used during my time at the 
Centre for Interdisciplinary Methodologies.

I spent a good period of time diving into the relevent literature and the 
papers which made the cut (rather good papers) are linked to below as well.

# Outline

Do you want to learn a new skill as a historian? The Information and
Digital Group Technology for Research (IDGT4R) team has been asked to
lead an introductory practitioners’ approach on the applications of
social networks as a complimentary 90-minute component to a composite
session (Networks: A Skills Workshop). This practical part to be
preceded by a talk from Kate Davidson (Sheffield) on Social Network
Analysis from her article on [Early Modern Social Networks: Antecedents,
Opportunities, and Challenges](https://doi.org/10.1093/ahr/rhz253) in American Historical Review.
