Welcome to my website.

I've worked in research and technology for 10 years - from a researcher in Psychology to an academic technologist in an interdisciplinary centre and now as a senior research software engineer in central services.

I work at every step of the research software cycle. From initial consultation, to supporing grants, then designing and writing both research software and infrastructure.
