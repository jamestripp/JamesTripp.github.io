The below research software projects are part of my work at the Centre for Interdisciplinary Methodologies.

# [Grapho](https://warwickcim.github.io/grapho/)

[![Project Status: WIP – Initial development is in progress, but there
has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the
public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)
[![R-CMD-check](https://github.com/WarwickCIM/grapho/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/WarwickCIM/grapho/actions)
[![Codecov test
coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/WarwickCIM/grapho/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/WarwickCIM/grapho?branch=master)

Grapho is an R package for recording the commands and visualisations created in an R session. Functions are provided for parsing and visualising the user workflow.

# [LE-CAT](https://warwickcim.github.io/lecat/)

[![Project Status: Active – The project has reached a stable, usable
state and is being actively
developed.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active)
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/WarwickCIM/lecat/branch/master/graph/badge.svg?token=RtMnQjfEcZ)](https://codecov.io/gh/WarwickCIM/lecat)
[![Build

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/161813229.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/161813229)

LE-CAT is a Lexicon-based Categorization and Analysis Tool developed by the Centre for Interdisciplinary Methodologies in collaboration with the Media of Cooperation Group at the University of Siegen.

# [Backfillz](https://warwickcim.github.io/lecat/)

[![Build
Status](https://travis-ci.org/warwickCIM/lecat.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/WarwickCIM/backfillz)
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/176701637.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/176701637)

Backfillz.R provides new visual diagnostics for understanding MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) analyses and outputs. MCMC chains can defy a simple line graph. Unless the chain is very short (which isn’t often the case), plotting tens or hundreds of thousands of data points reveals very little other than a ‘trace plot’ where we only see the outermost points. Common plotting methods may only reveal when an MCMC really hasn’t worked, but not when it has.
