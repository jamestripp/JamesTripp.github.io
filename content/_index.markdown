I'm a senior research software engineer at the University of Warwick working in the IDG Technology for Research group. My PhD is in Psychology and my thesis looked at cogitive models of memory and relative judgement. I wrote [R packages](https://github.com/warwickcim) as a senior academic technologist at the [Centre for Interdisciplinary Methodologies](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/cim/).

I write code and help people. It feels good and I keep at it. At the moment, I quite like Python, R, containers and cloud computing.
