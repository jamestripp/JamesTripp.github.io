I'm a senior research software engineer at the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk) working in the IDG Technology for Research group within [IDG](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/sim/newsandevents/working-securely-the-information-and-digital-group/). You can find a description of the RSE role [here](https://www.software.ac.uk/research-software-engineers). My PhD is in psychology and [my thesis](http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/60630/) looked at cogitive models of memory and relative judgement. I have written [R packages](https://github.com/warwickcim) as a senior academic technologist at the [Centre for Interdisciplinary Methodologies](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/cim/).

I write code and help people. At the moment, I quite like Python, R, containers and cloud computing.
