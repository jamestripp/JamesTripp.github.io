My work at the Centre for Interdisciplinary Methodologies, University of Warwick, encompasses several technological domains to support research and teaching at CIM. I design and deliver workshops in our Postgraduate modules, develop research software, provide bespoke technical support for the centre and manage/deploy the centreâ€™s server infrastructure.

My background is in Cognitive Science. I completed both a BSc(Hons) and PhD in Psychology at the University of Warwick, then worked as a Post-Doctoral research fellow. Throughout I carried out statistical analysis and wrote software. The software languages I use are R, HTML, Javascript, Python and C.
